* Build-once run-anywhere OpenGL application

Standing on the shoulders of [[https://justine.lol/cosmopolitan/index.html][Cosmopolitan libc]] this proof of concept
application should run on Windows and Unix systems running X11 (tested
on NixOS/Debian/FreeBSD for now, feedback about other systems
welcome).

I don't have any interest right now in macOS given their reluctance to
follow OpenGL/Vulkan standards, but it should be easy to make it run
on that as well.

* Building

Just modify the =mk= script to point to your =zipobj.com= and run it.
