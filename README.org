* Build-once run-anywhere OpenGL application

Standing on the shoulders of [[https://justine.lol/cosmopolitan/index.html][Cosmopolitan libc]] this proof of concept
application should run on Windows and Unix systems running X11 (only
Linux tested for now, feedback about other systems welcome).

I don't have any interest right now on macOS given their reluctance to
follow OpenGL/Vulkan standards, but it should be easy to make it run
on that as well.
